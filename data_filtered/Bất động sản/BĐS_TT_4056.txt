The premiere drew thousands of fans along the red carpet to see director James Cameron and the film’s main cast, including Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldaña, Sigourney Weaver, and Cliff Curtis.

Attendees lined up early to secure vantage points for the arrivals and autographs.

Wellington holds particular significance for the ‘Avatar’ franchise, as much of the post-production and visual effects work was done at Weta FX, a local visual effects company.

The premiere was described by local media as one of the largest film launches ever held in the city.

Three 'Avatar' sequels to be made in New Zealand: government

Rhymastic took part in official studio-organized activities at the event.

On his social media, he confirmed his attendance and said he had the opportunity to meet and speak with Cameron during side events, though the studio has not disclosed details of the private meetings.

Cameron also spoke to the audience about his long-standing connection to New Zealand throughout the production of the ‘Avatar’ series.

‘Avatar: Fire and Ash’ is the latest and third installment in James Cameron’s ‘Avatar’ franchise, following the 2009 original and its 2022 sequel, continuing the story set on the fictional world of Pandora.
