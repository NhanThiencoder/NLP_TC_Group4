Initial reports showed that from Friday afternoon, dozens of patients were admitted to An Phuoc Hospital and Binh Thuan General Hospital with symptoms including abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea and fever, prompting both hospitals later to report the incident to the provincial health department.

The provincial food safety authority then dispatched officials to the hospitals to collect information and interview patients.

All affected individuals reported eating 'banh mi' from the same outlet in Phan Thiet Ward.

Food samples related to the suspected poisoning have been collected and sent to the Pasteur Institute in neighboring Khanh Hoa Province for laboratory testing to determine the cause.

As of Sunday afternoon, 17 patients had been discharged, while 19 others remained under medical observation and treatment, the department said.

Meanwhile, a similar food poisoning incident was also reported over the weekend in Quang Ngai Province, central Vietnam.

On Saturday evening, Phuc Hung General Hospital in Quang Ngai said it had admitted 20 patients suspected of food poisoning after eating 'banh mi.'

All patients stated they had purchased the food from the H.V. 'banh mi' shop in the locality.

Health authorities in both provinces are continuing investigations and monitoring patients’ conditions.
